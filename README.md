# Computer Architecture Concepts

This repository focuses on core concepts and algorithms of **Computer Architecture**.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Booth's Multiplication Algorithm**: Efficient algorithm for multiplying binary integers, handling both positive and negative numbers.
- **Binary Adders**: Designs like Half Adder, Full Adder, Ripple Carry Adder, and Carry Lookahead Adder for binary arithmetic operations.
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Defines machine language instructions and addressing modes.

- **Cache Memory**: Fast memory storage to reduce data access time, including direct-mapped, fully associative, and set-associative caches.

- **Memory Management**: Concepts like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
- **I/O Systems**: Input/output mechanisms, including interrupt handling and Direct Memory Access (DMA).
- **Branch Prediction Algorithms**: Techniques like static and dynamic prediction to minimize pipeline stalls.
